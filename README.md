# Dcm2Dcm-Converter
Sometimes, a compressed dicom image need to be converted to standard dicom image to be read properly. This is easily achieved by this program and batch file

Thanks to 'gdcm'

Usage of the batch file. More info is here https://github.com/malaterre/GDCM/releases

just type 'convert.bat' from a command prompt window or double click it and all the files from e:\in will be converted to e:\out
If you need to change the directories of in and out, edit the batch according to your requirement. When the directory happens to be in C:\, run the batch file as Admin, else it may fail to run.

This program can be freely used by anyone. Hope this is useful to some physicists, radiologists and radiotherapists.

Some people have requested that whether a Windows GUI is possible instead of the command and batch file. If this can help the community, why not? So wrote a smll GUI wrapper in VB.NET. Extract the archive and run the DCM2DCM.exe and you can use it.
